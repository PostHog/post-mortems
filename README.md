# PostHog Post-mortems (Public)
When something goes wrong, we talk about it here and come up with a plan. Unless it's confidential or involves explicitly talking about customer data - in which case it should go in [our internal repo](https://github.com/PostHog/incidents-analysis).

Post-mortems usually happen after an incident or outage. It's the responsibility of the incident lead to make sure a post-mortem happens. If we don't have an incident lead, it's the responsibility of whoever opened the incident. 

You can stay updated about incidents via [our status page](https://status.posthog.com/).
